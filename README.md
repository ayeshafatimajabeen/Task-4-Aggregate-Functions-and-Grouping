An **aggregate function** performs a calculation on multiple rows and returns a single summary value.  
Common functions:
- `SUM()` – Total of values
- `AVG()` – Average value
- `COUNT()` – Number of items
- `MAX()` – Highest value
- `MIN()` – Lowest value

###  GROUP BY  
Used to **group rows** that have the same values in specified columns.  
It allows performing aggregate functions **on each group**.
